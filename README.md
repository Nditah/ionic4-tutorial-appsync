# ionic4-tutorial-appsync
This code is part of a tutorial on how to create an AWS AppSync GraphQL API and use that in an Ionic 4 app.

Read the tutorial here: [Ionic 4 + AppSync: Build a mobile app with a GraphQL backend](https://gonehybrid.com/ionic-4-appsync-build-a-mobile-app-with-a-graphql-backend-part-1/)

For more tutorials on Ionic, check out my blog [Gone Hybrid](http://gonehybrid.com).

# How to run the app
First, you'll need to follow the tutorial to set up the AppSync backend, see [part 2](https://gonehybrid.com/ionic-4-appsync-create-a-graphql-api-part-2/).

Then, run `npm install` followed by the `ionic serve` command.

Make sure you have all the tools installed, see [installation guide](http://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2-part-2/).
